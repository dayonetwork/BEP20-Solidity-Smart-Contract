/**
 * @title Rewarded Staking Contract
 * @dev Provides an address the possibility to earn rewards by keeping a 
 * certain amount of tokens in a separate storage. These tokens are burned 
 * from the balance and cannot be sent or used to pay for domains or aliases.
 * The staked amount can be removed at any given time and the token amount
 * is minted back into the balance. The reward can be redeemed and is 
 * calculated based on the block time - a 2% reward each 30 days.
 *
 * If the totalSupply reaches the maximum volume, rewards are still calculated,
 * but can only be redeemed after tokens are burned (not staked or vested).
 * Domains must be registered or updated or aliases must be set in order
 * for the totalSupply to decrease.
 * 
 * @notice If the reward is not redeemed before the staking is removed it will 
 * be lost!
